**# Data_Cleaning_FIFA_21_Power_Query**

Data cleaning and data cleansing play a crucial role in the initial stages of data preparation for
any data analysis or modeling project. These procedures allow us to verify the accuracy and
reliability of the data, leading to more precise and insightful outcomes in the analyses.
